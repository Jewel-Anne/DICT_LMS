# Instructions:
# Consider which operator should be used for the following operations,
# then solve the following problems.
# Make sure to use the print() function!
# 1.) Multiply 217 by 6.
# 2.) Add 600 to 35234.
# 3.) Divide 67 by 12. The answer should be a rounded-off number.
# 4.) Get the remainder of 56329 divided by 982.
# 5.) 34 to the power of 5.

# 1.) Multiply 217 by 6.
print(217 * 6) #uses asterisk sign for multiplication

# 2.) Add 600 to 35234.
print(600 + 35234) #uses plus sign for addition

# 3.) Divide 67 by 12. The answer should be a rounded-off number.
print(67 // 12) #uses floor division to round-off

# 4.) Get the remainder of 56329 divided by 982.
print(56329 % 982) #uses modulo or percentage sign for remainder.

# 5.) 34 to the power of 5.
print(34 ** 5) #uses double asterisk for exponent.
