# Instructions:
# Read each number carefully, then perform the task required.
# Make sure to use the print() function.
# 1.) Use the variables x = 332 and y = 2031
# 2.) Using an if statement, set the condition that if x >= y,
# "x is greater than or equal to y." will be printed on the console.
# 3.) Set an elif statement that states that x == y,
# which would print "x is equal to y" on the console.
# 4.) Set an else statement,
# which would print that "x is less than y" on the console.

x = 332
y = 2031

if x >= y:
    print("x is greater than or equal to y.")
elif x == y:
    print("xx is equal to y.")
else:
    print("x is less than y.")
