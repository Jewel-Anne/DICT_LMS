# Instructions
# Check each line of code and try to figure out what the errors are.
# Modify the code to let it run successfully.
# 1. printRoses are red, violets are blue
# 2. if 10>7:
#    print("Ten is greater than seven!")
#    if 16 < 42:
#    print("Sixteen is less than forty-two!")
# 3. print("A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...");

###############################################
# 1. printRoses are red, violets are blue
# the syntax is wrong. there is no parenthesis and quotation marks
# to indicate to print the texts.
# Instead, it should be like this:

print("Roses are red, violets are blue.")

###############################################
# 2. if 10>7:
#    print("Ten is greater than seven!")
#    if 16 < 42:
#    print("Sixteen is less than forty-two!")
# there should be indentation for blocks of code.
# Instead, it should look like this:

if 10 > 7:
    print("Ten is greater than seven!")
if 16 < 42:
    print("Sixteen is less than forty-two!")

###############################################
# 3. print("A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...");
# there is no need for a semicolon for python syntax.
# Instead, it should be like this:

print("A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...")
