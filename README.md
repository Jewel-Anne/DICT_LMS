# DICT_LMS
ICT training courses by Philippines' Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), 
through its ICT Literacy and Competency Development Bureau (ILCDBu) and in partnership with its Regional Offices. 

The Project was envisioned to transform the way the DICT delivers its literacy, learning,
and competency development courses to its employees, and external clientele (e.g. public 
and beneficiary institutions such as National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government 
Units, including State/Local Universities and Colleges (S/LUCs), among others.

The Project aims to usher scalability of delivery of courses/training programs with
progress monitoring tools, delivery of engaging asynchronous/blended ICT and related
courses, curation of content library, and seamless content sharing between participating
institutions.
